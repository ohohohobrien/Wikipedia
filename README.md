# Wikipedia

This web app is built with Django and Python. It allows users to create and edit articles simulating a wikipedia style site. The site dynamically creates pages and has a search function in built. As this is a dynamic site, I don't have it hosted currently so please feel free to review the code or watch my video explanation.

This was made as part of CS50's 2021 Web Development course.
